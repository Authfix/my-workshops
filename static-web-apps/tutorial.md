title: Setup your environment using dev container
---

Don't know what a dev container is ? see video

// TODO: Check if need docker ?

Click on the remote development extension icon and select `Add Development Container Configuration Files...` and search for `Azure Static Web Apps`

A few files will be added to your project with all the container configurations

Click again on the remote development extension icon to reopen your project in a container.

So what just happened? A docker image is mounted with all the tools you need to work on your Progressive Web App

title: Start with a website
---

Once upon a time, there was a website that needed a place to live, be visible to the world and a backend to be more interactive.

### Download the website template

Download from resources on the left or <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>

### Deploy your website on GitHub

Azure Static Web Apps has been built from the start to work with GitHub so, the first thing you will do is to create a new GitHub repo and push the source code you just downloaded.

Go on <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">Github.com</a>, create a new repository and push you code to it.

## Create a Azure Static Web App

In the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/" target="_blank">Azure Portal</a>, look for `Static Web App` in the search bar. Once you are on the product page, click on the `Create` button at the top left. Or, you can directly click <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.StaticApp" target="_blank">here ^^</a>. This link will  take you directly to the Static Web App creation form.  

Let's fill it!

* Select your subscription.
* Create a new resource group.

<div class="box info">
In Azure, a resource group is a logical container that holds resources usually related to an application or a project. A resource group can therefore contain virtual machines, storage accounts, web applications, databases and more.
</div>

* Give a name to your Static Web App.
* Select the free plan (we won't need any feature in the standard plan for this workshop).
* Select `West Europe` for your backend.

<div class="box tip">
It is recommended to host your backend in the closest region of your users.
</div>

* Select `GitHub` as a deployment source.

We are going to host our website on GitHub. Later in the workshop, we will see how Static Web Apps will automaticaly deploy our website every time we push new code to our repository.

* Log in with your GitHub account and select the repository and the branch of your project.

As we mentioned at the begining of the workshop, our app will have a backend and a frontend. In order for Static Web App to know what to deploy and where, we need to tell it where our apps are located in our repository.

Azure Static Web Apps can handle several well-known frontend frameworks and therefore, "compile" your Angular, React or Hugo application before deploying it.

In our case, we have a very simple Vanilla JavaScript appliation which does not require anything to run. So, let's choose `Custom`.
* In the `App location`, enter the `www/` folder as this is where our frontend is.
* In the `Api location`, enter the `api/` folder as this is where our backend is.

* Click on `Review + Create` and then on `Create`.

After a few minutes, your static web app will be created on Azure and your website deployed.

## So, what happened?

    
### On GitHub

When Azure created your Static Web App, it pushed a new YAML file in in the `.github/workflow` folder of your repository.

The files in this folder decribe the GitHub Actions, which are event-based actions that can be triggered by events like a `push`, a `new pull request`, a `new issue`, a `new collaborator` and many many more. 

You can see the complete list of triggers <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference"/>here</a>

<div class="box info">
events-that-trigger-workflows" target="_blank">here</a>
If you are not familiar with GitHub Actions, go have a look <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank">here</a>.
</div>

Let's have a look at the YAML file Azure created for us:
```
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed]
    branches:
      - main
```
Here, you see that the GitHub Action is going to be triggered every time there is a push on the `main branch` or everytime a pull request is `opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened` or `closed`.  
As we want our website to be redeployed automaticaly every time we push on our main branch, this is perfect!

Take a few minutes to read the YAML file and understand what exactly happens when the GitHub action is triggered. You can see that most of the information you entered when you created your Static Web App on Azure is here.

<div class="box tip">
The YAML file is in your GitHub repo so you can edit it! Your frontend site folder name changed? No problem, just edit the file and push it on GitHub.
</div>

So, go back to your GitHub repo and click on the `Actions` tab. Here, you will see the list of all the GitHub actions that have been triggered so far. Click on the last one to see your application being deployed

### On Azure

Once your Static Web App is created, go to the Resource page. You can find the list of all your Static Web Apps <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Web%2FStaticSites" target="_blank">here</a>

In the overview panel of your resource, look for the `URL` parameter. This is the url of your website. 

![Configuration des variables d'environnement dans Azure Function](media/resource-overview.png)


Go have a look, your TODO list app has been deployed and is accessible to the world!

Congratulations, you just deployed your first Static Web App on Azure !

title: Let's add a backend
---

## Let's add a backend

Now that our TODO app is deployed, we want to make it interactive. Therefore, we want to interact with a backend!  

Azure Static Web Apps relies on Azure Functions for your application backend. Azure Functions is an Azure Service which enables you to deploy simple functions triggered by events. In our case, events will be HTTP calls.

<div class="box info">
Ever heard of Serverless or FaaS (Function as a Service)? Well, this is what Azure Functions is ^^.
</div>


### Installation

You can create an Azure Function from the portal but let's be honnest, it's so much easier to stay in VSCode and use the Azure Functions extension.

So, start by installing the Azure Function extension from VSCode.
You can download the extension either directly from the `Extension panel` (Ctrl+Shift+X) in VSCode or by going <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions" target="_blank">here</a> and clicking on the Install button.

### Create your Function app

Azure functions lives in an Azure Functions App. When you create your app, a function will be created. You can then add as many function as you need. 
So, let's create our Functions App and a function to retrive out tasks list.

* In VSCode, open the Command panel and search for `Azure Functions: Create Function App in Azure`. 
* Select the `api` folder. This is where our Function App will be created.
* Choose `JavaScript` as this is the langage we are going to use to write our Function.

<div class="box info">
Not all the Azure Functions languages are supported. You can write your Azure Static Web App backend in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python or C#.
</div>

* As we are creating a REST API that will be called by our website, the trigger we are looking for is the `HTTP trigger`. 
* Our first function will be used to retrieve our tasks list. Let's call it `tasks-get`. 
* Select the `Anonymous` authorization level.

<div class="box info">
<div>
If you want to learn more about the different authorization level and how to secure your API, go check <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/security-concepts" target="_blank">this link</a>
</div>
</div>

A function template will be created for you so you don't start with a blank file. Let's modify it for our needs.

Right now, we don't have a database to store our users or our tasks so let's use an array as a "fake" database.

```json
const tasks = [
    tasks: [
      {
        id: 1,
        label: "üçî Eat",
        status: ""
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        label: "üõè Sleep",
        status: ""
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        label: "</> Code",
        status: ""
      }
    ]
]
```

<div class="box assignment">
<div>
Modify the Azure Function so it returns the list of tasks.
</div>
</div>

Once deployed, you will be able to call your function like any REST API. 

### Configure your endpoints

By default, when an Azure Function is created using the VSCode extension, the function will manage `GET` and `POST` requests and the url will end with your function name. In our case, the `tasks-get` function can either be called using
* `GET https://your-website-url.com/api/tasks-get`
* `POST https://your-website-url.com/api/tasks-get`

This is not exactly what we need. Hopefuly, there is a way to configure this. Open the `function.json` file in your function folder.

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "anonymous",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "methods": [
        "get",
        "post"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "res"
    }
  ]
}
```
You can find here most of the information you selected when you created your unction.  
As we only need our function to retrieve a list of tasks, let's remove the `post` method in the methods array. Our function will only be able to be called using `GET` request.

The other think you may want to change the the url of your function. Having a route called `/api/tasks-get` is not very standard. You can easily change your enpoint name in the function.json file by adding a `route` parameter.

```json
{
    ...,
    "methods": ["get"],
    "route": "tasks"
    ...
}
```

Now, your function is only accessible using a `GET /api/tasks` request.

You've done it. You wrote your first Azure Function. Congratulations !

Title: Test you project locally
---

## Test your project locally

There are two ways to test your project. You can either push your code on GitHub every time you need to test (not recommended), or use the Static Web Apps CLI

### The Static Web App CLI

The Static Web Apps CLI, also known as SWA CLI, serves as a local development tool for Azure Static Web Apps. In our case, we will use the CLI to:
* Serve static app assets
* Serve API requests
* Emulate authentication and authorization
* Emulate Static Web Apps configuration, including routing


You can install the CLI via npm.
```bash
npm install -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli
```

You can find all the features the CLI provides <a href="https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-cli" target="_blank">here</a>

### Run your project locally

The CLI offers many options but in our case, we want it to serve both our API located in our `api` folder and our web application located in our `www` folder.

In your terminal, type the following command to start your project:

```bash
swa start ./www --api ./api --devserver-timeout=60000
```

This CLI gives you two urls:
* http://0.0.0.0:4280 corresponding to your frontend
* http://localhost:7071/api/tasks corresonding to you api

<div class="box info">
The CLI may take more time than usual to launch your Azure Function. The default timeout is 30 seconds but you can increase it using the "--devserver-timeout=60000" parameter
</div>

Congratulations, you now have everything you need to test your app!

title: Add authentication
---

## Add authentication

Azure Static Web Apps manages authentication out of the box. There are pre-configured providers but you can add you own custom providers if needed. Among the pre-configured ones are `Twitter`, `Google`, `Microsoft`, `GitHub` and others.

### Login/Logout

When I said "out of the box", I really meant it. You don't need to do anything for most of the providers. Let's use the GitHub one for our application. The only thing you will have to do is a button that redirect to `/.auth/login/github`.

<div class="box assignment">
Go add a button in the `login.html` page.
</div>

By default, once logged in, your user is redirected to the same page. However, we would like our user to be redirected to our TODO page after successfully logging in. You can do that by using the `post_login_redirect_uri` query param at the end of the url. Eg. `?post_login_redirect_uri=/index.html` 

<div class="box tip">
<div>
If you are building a React app, go <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/publish-static-web-app-authentication/?WT.mc_id=javascript-17844-cxa" target="_blank">check the MSLearn module that will show you how to do</a>
</div>
</div>

### Getting user information

Once your user is authenticated, you can retrieve the associated information by fetching the url `/.auth/me`. This will return a json containing a clientPrincipal object. If the object is null, the user is not authenticated. Otherwize, the object contains several data

```json
{
  "identityProvider": "github",
  "userId": "d75b260a64504067bfc5b2905e3b8182",
  "userDetails": "tagazok",
  "userRoles": ["anonymous", "authenticated"]
}
```
The userId is unique and can be used to identify the user. We will use it to refer to the user in the database.

<div class="box assignment">
<div>
Retrive the logged in user information and display the usernmae in the `<div id="username"></div>` element located at the top left of your webpage.
</div>
</div>

![Configuration des variables d'environnement dans Azure Function](media/todo.png)

Congratulations, you can now login to your app!

--sep--

Title: Routes & Roles
---

## Routes & Roles

In many cases, your routes will be managed by your frontend, especially if you are using a framework such as React or Angular.   
You may also be used to manage authorization on your backend for your API calls.

Azure Static Web Apps give you the opportunity to handle http requests in a single file. Start by creating a file called `staticwebapp.config.json` in your www folder.

There are many properties available to confiture your Static Web App but let's concentrate only on the few we need in our app.

The `routes` parameter is an array of all the rules for your routes. For example, in our case, we would like to prevent non-authorized users to call our API. We can do that very easily

```json
{
   "routes": [
      {
          "route": "/api/tasks/*",
          "allowedRoles": [
              "authenticated"
          ]
      }
    ]
}
```

What if we want to restrict part of our frontend to authenticated users? We can do exactly the same with any frontend route

```json
{
   "routes": [
      {
          "route": "/",
          "allowedRoles": [
              "authenticated"
          ]
      }
    ]
}
```

Here, your website root will only be accessible to logged in users. Now, if you try that, you will notice that your users are redirected to a default 401 web page. We can customise that using another property of the config file. The `responseOverrides` property enables you to redirect a user to a specific page when an HTTP code is returned. Here, let's redirect all non-authenticated users to the login.html page

```json
{
   "responseOverrides": {
        "401": {
            "redirect": "/login.html"
        }
    },
}
```

<div class="box assignment">
Create a custom-404.html page in your www folder and add a rule to redirect users to this page when they enter a url which does not exist.
</div>

<div class="tip">
This is also very useful if you are doing a SPA (Single Page Application) where the routing is managed on the client side. You may then need to redirect all your urls to `index.html`. Check the `navigationFallback` property in the documentation <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration" target="_blank">here</a>
</div>

--sep--
---
Title: MISC
---


`staticwebapp.config.json`

So what do we want? We want the our JavaScript framework to handle the routes so we simply ask Staticweb app to redirect all urls to index.html

However, we don't want our router to mess with our assets so let's exclude all the other resources like stylesheets or images.


```

However, you can still overide all the urls you want here. Let's say you have a new url for your products list as `products` makes more sense than `catelog`. You can easily do that in the `routes` object.

```javascript
{
    ...,
    "routes": [
        {
            "route": "/catalog",
            "redirect": "/products"
        }
    ]
}
```
